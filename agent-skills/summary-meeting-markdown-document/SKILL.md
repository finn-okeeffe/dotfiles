# Summary And Actions From Meeting Transcript

## Overview

Create a summary and list of actions from the transcript contained in transcript.txt. To each action, state who it is assigned to, and when it is due. Note if these are missing. The summary should go into a new folder called summary.txt, and the actions into actions.txt. Do not run any code, just create these text files.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Asked for by the user only.

## Instructions

- Summarise the meeting contained in transcript.txt.
- Create actions, and where possible, who is assigned and what the due date is.
- If a person the action is assigned to is missing, or the due date is missing, note that.
- Write the summary section at the top of your final response, then the actions.
- The highest priority / most urgent actions should go at the top of the actions section.
- Do not create or run any code, just write the summary and the actions.
- Use the ask questions tool if you need to clarify requirements or context with the user.
